## 1. Introduction

The landscape of large language models has evolved rapidly since the introduction of the Transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. (2017). This evolution has led to diverse architectural approaches, each addressing specific challenges in language modeling, computational efficiency, and task performance. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of four major LLM families: GPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Llama, analyzing their architectural innovations and mathematical foundations.

### 1.1 Motivation

Understanding the architectural differences between these models is crucial for:
- Selecting appropriate models for specific applications
- Understanding computational trade-offs
- Informing future architectural developments
- Optimizing deployment strategies

## 2. Foundational Transformer Architecture

Before examining specific models, we establish the mathematical foundation of the Transformer architecture that underlies all four model families.

### 2.1 Multi-Head Attention

The core attention mechanism is defined as:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```

Where:
- Q ∈ ℝ^(n×d_k): Query matrix
- K ∈ ℝ^(n×d_k): Key matrix  
- V ∈ ℝ^(n×d_v): Value matrix
- d_k: Dimension of key vectors
- n: Sequence length

Multi-head attention extends this to:

```
MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
```

Where:
```
head_i = Attention(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)
```

### 2.2 Position Encoding

Positional information is encoded using sinusoidal functions:

```
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
```

## 3. GPT Architecture Analysis

### 3.1 Architectural Overview

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) employs a decoder-only Transformer architecture optimized for autoregressive language generation.

**Key Architectural Features:**
- Decoder-only transformer blocks
- Causal (masked) self-attention
- Layer normalization placement variations across versions
- Absolute positional encoding (GPT-1/2) to learned positional embeddings

### 3.2 Mathematical Framework

#### 3.2.1 Causal Self-Attention

GPT uses causal masking to ensure autoregressive properties:

```
Attention_causal(Q, K, V) = softmax(M ⊙ (QK^T / √d_k))V
```

Where M is a lower triangular mask matrix:
```
M_ij = {0 if i < j, -∞ if i ≥ j}
```

#### 3.2.2 Layer Structure

Each GPT layer follows:
```
h_l = LayerNorm(h_{l-1} + MHA(h_{l-1}))
h_l = LayerNorm(h_l + FFN(h_l))
```

Where FFN is a feed-forward network:
```
FFN(x) = W_2 · ReLU(W_1 · x + b_1) + b_2
```

### 3.3 Scaling Properties

GPT models demonstrate power-law scaling relationships:
- Parameters: O(d_model^2 · n_layers)
- Computational complexity: O(n^2 · d_model + n · d_model^2)
- Memory usage: O(n · d_model · n_layers)

**GPT Model Progression:**
- GPT-1: 117M parameters, 12 layers, 768 hidden size
- GPT-2: 1.5B parameters, 48 layers, 1600 hidden size  
- GPT-3: 175B parameters, 96 layers, 12288 hidden size
- GPT-4: ~1.7T parameters (estimated), mixture of experts

## 4. DeepSeek Architecture Analysis

### 4.1 Architectural Innovations

DeepSeek introduces several architectural optimizations focused on efficiency and performance:

**Key Features:**
- Multi-head latent attention (MLA)
- DeepSeekMoE (Mixture of Experts)
- Optimized attention mechanisms
- Advanced positional encodings

### 4.2 Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)

DeepSeek's MLA reduces the KV cache size significantly:

```
MLA(X) = (X W^{DQ}) (X W^{UK})^T (X W^{UV}) / √d
```

Where:
- W^{DQ} ∈ ℝ^{d×d_q}: Down-projection for queries
- W^{UK} ∈ ℝ^{d×d_c}: Up-projection for keys
- W^{UV} ∈ ℝ^{d×d_c}: Up-projection for values

### 4.3 DeepSeekMoE Architecture

The mixture of experts mechanism:

```
MoE(x) = Σ_{i=1}^N G(x)_i · E_i(x)
```

Where:
- G(x): Gating function
- E_i(x): i-th expert network
- N: Number of experts

**Gating Function:**
```
G(x) = softmax(x W_g + b_g)
```

### 4.4 Efficiency Metrics

DeepSeek achieves:
- 75% reduction in KV cache size
- 25% increase in throughput
- Comparable performance to standard attention

## 5. Gemini Architecture Analysis

### 5.1 Multimodal Architecture

Gemini represents a significant departure from text-only models, incorporating multimodal capabilities from the ground up.

**Architectural Components:**
- Multimodal encoder-decoder architecture
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Unified tokenization across modalities
- Mixture of experts for different modalities

### 5.2 Cross-Modal Attention

Gemini employs specialized attention for cross-modal interactions:

```
CrossAttention(Q_text, K_image, V_image) = softmax(Q_text K_image^T / √d_k) V_image
```

### 5.3 Multimodal Tokenization

Input representation combines multiple modalities:

```
Input = Concat(TokenizeText(T), TokenizeImage(I), TokenizeAudio(A))
```

Where each tokenization function maps to a shared embedding space:
```
Embed(token) ∈ ℝ^{d_model}
```

### 5.4 Performance Characteristics

**Gemini Model Variants:**
- Gemini Nano: 1.8B/3.25B parameters
- Gemini Pro: ~30B parameters (estimated)
- Gemini Ultra: ~175B parameters (estimated)

**Capabilities:**
- Text, image, audio, and video understanding
- Code generation and reasoning
- Mathematical problem solving

## 6. Llama Architecture Analysis

### 6.1 Efficiency-Focused Design

Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) prioritizes computational efficiency while maintaining performance.

**Key Innovations:**
- RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm
- SwiGLU activation function
- Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)
- Grouped Query Attention (GQA)

### 6.2 RMSNorm Implementation

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization:

```
RMSNorm(x) = x / √(1/d Σ_{i=1}^d x_i^2) · γ
```

Where γ is a learnable scaling parameter.

**Advantages:**
- Faster computation (no mean subtraction)
- Better numerical stability
- Reduced memory bandwidth

### 6.3 Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)

RoPE encodes positional information by rotating query and key vectors:

```
q_m = R_m q_m
k_n = R_n k_n
```

Where R_m is a rotation matrix:
```
R_m = [cos(mθ) -sin(mθ)]
      [sin(mθ)  cos(mθ)]
```

### 6.4 Grouped Query Attention (GQA)

GQA reduces the number of key-value heads:

```
GQA(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
```

Where keys and values are shared across query groups:
```
head_i = Attention(Q_i, K_{⌊i/g⌋}, V_{⌊i/g⌋})
```

### 6.5 SwiGLU Activation

The SwiGLU activation function:

```
SwiGLU(x) = Swish(xW + b) ⊙ (xV + c)
```

Where:
```
Swish(x) = x · sigmoid(βx)
```
