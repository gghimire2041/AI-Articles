## Introduction

The **Transformer architecture**, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in deep learning and natural language processing. This revolutionary model architecture has become the foundation for modern language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and countless other state-of-the-art AI systems.

### Key Innovation
> **The core insight**: Attention mechanisms can effectively capture long-range dependencies in sequences without the need for recurrence or convolution, leading to better parallelization and dramatically improved performance.

---

## The Problem with Previous Architectures

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Before Transformers, sequence-to-sequence tasks were dominated by RNNs and their variants (LSTM, GRU). However, these architectures had several limitations:

**Sequential Processing**: RNNs process sequences step-by-step, making parallelization impossible during training.

**Vanishing Gradients**: Despite LSTM improvements, very long sequences still suffered from gradient vanishing problems.

**Limited Context**: Information from early tokens often gets lost in long sequences.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs were also used for sequence modeling, but they had their own limitations:

**Fixed Receptive Fields**: Required multiple layers to capture long-range dependencies.

**Position Sensitivity**: Difficult to handle variable-length sequences effectively.

---

## The Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism is the heart of the Transformer architecture. It allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element.

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention

The fundamental building block is **scaled dot-product attention**:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) × V
```

Where:
- **Q** (Queries): What we're looking for
- **K** (Keys): What's available to match against  
- **V** (Values): The actual information to retrieve
- **d_k**: Dimension of key vectors (for scaling)

### Step-by-Step Attention Computation

1. **Compute Attention Scores**:
   ```
   scores = Q × K^T
   ```

2. **Scale the Scores**:
   ```
   scaled_scores = scores / √d_k
   ```
   *Scaling prevents gradients from becoming too small when d_k is large*

3. **Apply Softmax**:
   ```
   attention_weights = softmax(scaled_scores)
   ```
   *This ensures all weights sum to 1*

4. **Weight the Values**:
   ```
   output = attention_weights × V
   ```

### Attention Matrix Visualization

Consider the sentence: "The cat sat on the mat"

```
Attention Matrix (simplified):
         The  cat  sat  on  the  mat
    The [0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2]
    cat [0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]  
    sat [0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.05,0.05,0.0]
    on  [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]
    the [0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
    mat [0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
```

Higher values indicate stronger attention between word pairs.

---

## Multi-Head Attention

Instead of using a single attention function, Transformers employ **multi-head attention**, allowing the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces simultaneously.

### Mathematical Definition

```
MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head₁, head₂, ..., head_h) × W^O

where head_i = Attention(Q×W_i^Q, K×W_i^K, V×W_i^V)
```

### Parameters:
- **h**: Number of attention heads (typically 8 or 16)
- **W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V**: Learned linear projections for each head
- **W^O**: Output projection matrix

### Why Multiple Heads?

Each attention head can focus on different types of relationships:

**Head 1**: Syntactic relationships (subject-verb)  
**Head 2**: Semantic relationships (synonyms, antonyms)  
**Head 3**: Positional relationships (adjacent words)  
**Head 4**: Long-range dependencies  
...and so on.

### Computational Complexity

For a sequence of length n and model dimension d:
- **Self-attention**: O(n² × d)
- **Recurrent**: O(n × d²)
- **Convolutional**: O(k × n × d²) where k is kernel size

---

## Complete Transformer Architecture

The full Transformer model consists of an **encoder** and **decoder**, each containing multiple identical layers.

### Encoder Architecture

Each encoder layer contains:

1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
2. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**
3. **Residual connections** around each sub-layer
4. **Layer normalization**

```
Encoder Layer:
x₁ = LayerNorm(x + MultiHeadAttention(x, x, x))
x₂ = LayerNorm(x₁ + FeedForward(x₁))
```

### Decoder Architecture

Each decoder layer contains:

1. **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention**
2. **Multi-Head Cross-Attention** (attending to encoder output)
3. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**
4. **Residual connections and layer normalization**

```
Decoder Layer:
x₁ = LayerNorm(x + MaskedMultiHeadAttention(x, x, x))
x₂ = LayerNorm(x₁ + MultiHeadAttention(x₁, encoder_output, encoder_output))
x₃ = LayerNorm(x₂ + FeedForward(x₂))
```

## Position Encoding

Since Transformers lack inherent sequence order (unlike RNNs), **positional encodings** are added to input embeddings to provide position information.

### Sinusoidal Position Encoding

The original Transformer uses sinusoidal functions:

```
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
```

Where:
- **pos**: Position in the sequence
- **i**: Dimension index
- **d_model**: Model dimension

### Why Sinusoidal?

1. **Unique Encoding**: Each position gets a unique encoding
2. **Relative Positions**: Model can learn to attend by relative positions
3. **Extrapolation**: Can handle sequences longer than training examples
4. **Mathematical Properties**: Sin and cos functions have useful periodicity

### Position Encoding Visualization

```

Pos  Dim0   Dim1   Dim2   Dim3   Dim4   Dim5   Dim6   Dim7
0   [0.00, 1.00, 0.00, 1.00, 0.00, 1.00, 0.00, 1.00]

3   [0.14,-0.99, 0.30, 0.95, 0.03, 1.00, 0.00, 1.00]
```

## Layer Normalization and Residual Connections

### Residual Connections

Residual connections help with gradient flow and training stability:

```
output = LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))
```

This is applied around each sub-layer (attention and feed-forward).

### Layer Normalization

Layer normalization normalizes across the feature dimension:

```
LayerNorm(x) = γ × (x - μ) / σ + β
```

Where:
- **μ**: Mean across features
- **σ**: Standard deviation across features  
- **γ, β**: Learnable parameters

### Pre-norm vs Post-norm

**Post-norm** (Original Transformer):
```
x = LayerNorm(x + MultiHeadAttention(x))
```

**Pre-norm** (More common now):
```
x = x + MultiHeadAttention(LayerNorm(x))
```

Pre-norm often leads to more stable training.

---

## Training Process

### Teacher Forcing

During training, the decoder uses **teacher forcing**:
- The correct target sequence is provided as input
- Model learns to predict the next token given all previous correct tokens
- Masked attention prevents "looking ahead"

### Loss Function

**Cross-entropy loss** for next-token prediction:

```
Loss = -Σ log P(y_t | y_<t, x)
```

Where:
- **y_t**: True next token
- **y_<t**: All previous tokens
- **x**: Input sequence

### Masking in Self-Attention

**Encoder**: No masking (bidirectional attention)  
**Decoder**: Causal masking (can only attend to previous positions)

```python
# Causal mask (lower triangular matrix)
mask = np.tril(np.ones((seq_len, seq_len)))
# Apply mask by setting masked positions to -inf before softmax
scores[mask == 0] = -np.inf
```

∂L/∂K = (∂L/∂Attention) × (Q^T × softmax'(scores))  
∂L/∂V = (∂L/∂Attention) × softmax(scores)^T
```

3. **Attention Patterns**: Sparse attention for very long sequences

### Scaling Laws

**Model Performance** scales predictably with:
- **Parameters** (N)
- **Dataset size** (D)  
- **Compute** (C)

```
Loss ∝ min(N^(-α), D^(-β), C^(-γ))
```

Where α ≈ 0.076, β ≈ 0.095, γ ≈ 0.050

## Advanced Topics

### Sparse Attention Patterns

**Longformer**: Sliding window + global attention  
**Big Bird**: Random + window + global attention  
**Linformer**: Low-rank approximation of attention

### Relative Position Representations

Instead of absolute positions, use relative distances:

```
e_ij = (x_i W^Q)(x_j W^K + r_{i-j})^T
```

Where **r_{i-j}** encodes relative position.

### Layer-wise Learning Rate Decay

Different learning rates for different layers:
```
lr_layer_k = lr_base × decay_rate^(L-k)
```
